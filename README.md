*Backstory: I did not end up putting it in the Unity Asset Store as I planned, but I have shared the code with some of the people that contacted me about it while still hoping it will end up on the Asset Store eventually. The latter turned out to be a lot harder than I thought and the fact that the e-mail stated in the thesis is now discontinued makes it even harder to obtain the code. In hopes that my algorithm can still be useful for game developers as intended, I am now just making the code public.
The version uploaded is currently the one I've been sharing, appologies that it's so out-of-date and not clean code at all. But the logic is still there. I think it's better than nothing at least.*

## Thesis
### Edge Chamfering Algorithm:
https://comserv.cs.ut.ee/ati_thesis/datasheet.php?id=62223&year=2018

#### Abstract
When comparing real-life objects and 3D models, one telltale sign that an object in question is a model, is the sharpness of its edges. This is more apparent for hard surface models like models depicting furniture and machinery, which look more real if their edges are a bit rounder. The goal of this thesis is to create an algorithm that uses the edge chamfering technique to automatically smooth out all hard edges of a mesh. The thesis describes 3D models and how they are stored in a game engine, different ways to soften hard edges, and the implementation of the created algorithm.
