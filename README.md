## Thesis
### Edge Chamfering Algorithm:
https://comserv.cs.ut.ee/ati_thesis/datasheet.php?id=62223&year=2018

#### Abstract
When comparing real-life objects and 3D models, one telltale sign that an object in question is a model, is the sharpness of its edges. This is more apparent for hard surface models like models depicting furniture and machinery, which look more real if their edges are a bit rounder. The goal of this thesis is to create an algorithm that uses the edge chamfering technique to automatically smooth out all hard edges of a mesh. The thesis describes 3D models and how they are stored in a game engine, different ways to soften hard edges, and the implementation of the created algorithm.
